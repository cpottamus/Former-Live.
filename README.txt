Hey James!

I'm making a README now to test out github. We're gonna be using this repo to create the website for andy.

Given the framework we're going to be working with. It seems like this project is mostly going to be writing the scripts for the following:
-a Contact page. (where the user can write something to be forwarded to andy's artist email).
-an image viewing page (an attractive way for the user to move within the various image galleries)
-a blog of sorts (for him to post his future works with accompanying text, dates, thoughts, etc... Needs to function kind of like a wordpress blog)
-scripts that will tie in whatever CMS we use to the pages above (so that andy can upload his own blog posts and images and they will be sorted into the appropriate places).

Other than that it will just be CSS and HTML, which we'll work with kind of as we go. He gave me a bunch of examples but most of them revolved around this site design:

http://www.bretslater.com/

It's just about as minimalist as you can get. I figure we'll start from there and then use some jquery to make the way you interact with the website more attractive than static links. Obviously the
image gallery on that site is shit (and empty), so we'll do better there as well.

Sound good?
